## Development
Because we developed defense game called 'GG told me' by using Unity engine, we decided to use unity engine in this game.

Unity ver : 2018.1.02f

We co-developed critical area like character movement, map and obstacle generation.

We divides the role UI, camera, sound and effect areas. Also, we discuss character and item design with our artist.

Several technics are used in this game. Camera movement and making launch video by using timeline functions are representitive of that.
